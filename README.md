# Swift Function Call Error: Missing Parameter Label

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: forgetting to include parameter labels when calling functions with multiple parameters.

The `bug.swift` file shows the incorrect function call, resulting in a compiler error.  The `bugSolution.swift` file provides the corrected code.  This error is often overlooked by beginners and experienced developers alike, leading to unexpected compiler errors. This is a subtle but important aspect of Swift's syntax.
